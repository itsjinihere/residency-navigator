# Residency Navigator

Residency Navigator is a web-based assistant designed to help Cal Poly students navigate the complex process of reclassifying as California residents for tuition purposes.

Built with a full-stack architecture (React + Node.js + Express), this application provides **dynamic, personalized guidance** through eligibility checks, document uploads, RDD validation, and progress tracking.

## Why This Project?
Every year, many students miss out on in-state tuition because the residency reclassification process is confusing and intimidating. Residency Navigator brings clarity by acting as:
- A **quiz** to determine your residency category
- A **checklist builder** tailored to your category
- A **progress tracker** based on document uploads
- A **smart analyzer** for your documents (extracts keywords and dates)
- An **eligibility estimator** based on CSU rules

---

## Features
### Residency Category Quiz
- Interactive 10-question quiz to classify students as:
  - Independent
  - Dependent under 19
  - Military
  - Above 19 Dependent on CA parents (new!)
  - Above 19 Dependent on Non-CA parents (new! â†’ shows ineligibility + tips)

### Dynamic Document Checklist
- Checklist changes based on your quiz results.
- Customizes requirements for List A and List B documents.
- Updates live as you upload files.

### Live Progress Tracker
- Real-time progress bar showing how close you are to checklist completion.

### PDF Upload + Analysis
- Upload any supporting document (ID, lease, tax return, etc.)
- The backend extracts:
  - Number of pages
  - Snippets of text
  - Detected keywords
  - Detected dates (for RDD validation)

### Residency Determination Date (RDD) Validation
- Automatically checks if a document is **older than the required RDD** (e.g., CA ID must be issued before RDD).
- Alerts if a document might be issued **after** RDD, marking it as risky.

### Intelligent Eligibility Feedback
- Dynamically calculates your eligibility status based on:
  - Quiz answers
  - Document checklist progress
  - Uploaded document dates

### Personalized Suggestions (NEW)
- If you're not currently eligible (e.g., dependent on non-CA parents), the system suggests realistic ways to become eligible (e.g., gain financial independence, parents move to CA, marriage, etc.).
